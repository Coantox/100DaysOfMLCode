# 100 Days Of ML Code

## This is my own personal log for this challenge. Hope i will get it done!

### Day 0: 3 January 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started to review Week 1-4 from Andrew Ng ML course.

**Thoughts:** I feel really weird with week 5 so i went back and looked at the basics. Hopefully i will get a better understanding from them.
